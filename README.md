# Dog Breeds App
So in this project I've worked with JSON, passing the data between the views, delegates, page and pickerViews, SCLArertView dependency, SafariServices and orther beautiful things of iOS development. 
The app is all about dogs. Just because I love them very much. Here you can see all the breeds that were taken from Dogs.API, you can check which breed is the most suitable for you (it was not made till the end because it needs a lot of different variations, but the main idea of this is understandable). You are able to check out some of the trainings for your pet and go to the YouTube to watch a video how to make these exercises. There are additional information and profile tabs as well where you can ask a question, check the app version, rate the app, change you country and other things.
Hope it made you smile!
